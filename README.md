<!-- ## Course Evaluation: please go to  https://forms.gle/cK3stUy8XigeXJTb9 to fill the course evaluation form. -->


### Course Prerequisites

If you do not already have them, please obtain accounts at:
* https://github.com
* https://orcid.org.
  
GitHub and ORCID are mandatory to use MorphoCloud. 
  
Also you will **need a 3-button mouse (cannot emphasize this enough)** to operate 3D Slicer (or any other 3D software) effectively. Optionally, [install the latest stable version (v5.10.0) of Slicer.](https://download.slicer.org) on your own computer as a backup, in case you have issues with cloud connections. 

Finally, having a second monitor is advised, since that will allow you to keep your zoom and cloud sessions on separate screens. 

### MorphoCloud On Demand
We will run this course through our cloud platform, MorphoCloud (MC) On Demand. Please read more about MorphoCloud instances at https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/blob/main/MorphoCloud/README.md. For ideal performance, we suggest using a wired ethernet connection at your university's campus. A dedicated wifi network (like your home) should also work fine. Try to avoid public wifi access points due to unpredictable network performance. I also advise setting TurboVNC client on your computer for better performance, please read option #2 under https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/blob/main/MorphoCloud/README.md#you-have-two-options-to-connect-to-gui. 

Your MC instances are configured to be available 7/24 throughout the course. They will be **taken offline on Friday night following the course and be deleted**. So if you have anything important make sure you download them at the end of the course. After the course, if you are interested in continuing to use the MorphoCloud Instances, you can follow the instructions at https://morphocloud.org

### Some important points about MorphoCloud On Demand sessions:
* Always keep your data in the **MyData** storage volume. This is your persistent storage, data stored elsewhere may get deleted.
* While using the Guacamole (the web browser connection) Use the `CTRL(CMD in Mac) + ALT + SHIFT` combination to make the cloud connection side window visible (or to make it disappear, if visible). This is where you can transfer file to and from cloud.
* Apart from transfering files, we highly encourage you to install and use the free **TurboVNC** software to connect to MC. Read more about your connection options at: https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/blob/main/MorphoCloud/README.md#you-have-two-options-to-connect-to-gui
* For best user experience, switch to full screen mode in your browser window (not advisable if you do not have a second monitor, as you won't be able to see the zoom window).

#### MorphoCloud Desktop

<img src="https://github.com/MorphoCloud/MorphoCloudInstances/blob/main/MCI_Desktop.png" width=1000>

- **A:** Side toolbar that gets activated by pressing the `CTRL (or CMD)` +
  `ALT` + `SHIFT` keys. It allows copy/paste into the remote session, browse and
  download files on the remote drive (only available if you are using web browser to connect to MC).
- **B:** Shortcuts to commonly used applications and to **MyData** storage
  volume.
- **C:** Displays list of available applications (searchable)
- **D:** Right mouse clicking anywhere on desktop brings this menu, including
  changing screen resolution (Display settings).
- **E:** Click on this icon anytime to extend your session for additional 4
  hours (not necessary for the course).

#### Mapping the Sample Data Drive
Remember the course sample data is available under **/media/shares/MorphoCloudCephShare/SlicerMorph102**</br>
You need to run the command below (once) to map this path to your instance.
```
curl https://jetstream2.exosphere.app/exosphere/assets/scripts/mount_ceph.py | sudo python3 - mount \
  --access-rule-name="MorphoCloudCephShare-ro" \
  --access-rule-key="AQAIDi1nKwbRFRAA9KKHUddANj6Ywj8ag7N9pg==" \
  --share-path="149.165.158.38:6789,149.165.158.22:6789,149.165.158.54:6789,149.165.158.70:6789,149.165.158.86:6789:/volumes/_nogroup/60bf684c-51d1-4abb-93f5-188d4d164111/1fe273cd-1e4d-4087-ad2b-01d548a16fe0" \
  --share-name="MorphoCloudCephShare"
```
This is a one-time setup, unless the instance has to be deleted and re-created. Share will be mapped to:

`/media/share/MorphoCloudCephShare` and **it will be read-only**. 

For us to be able to exchange data for course related activities, you can map this temp share. Again in the terminal window, execute this command;
```
curl https://jetstream2.exosphere.app/exosphere/assets/scripts/mount_ceph.py | sudo python3 - mount \
  --access-rule-name="TempShare-rw" \
  --access-rule-key="AQCWhCJp1nOXEBAAHZQEbN/oxYOayqRdviDb7Q==" \
  --share-path="149.165.158.38:6789,149.165.158.22:6789,149.165.158.54:6789,149.165.158.70:6789,149.165.158.86:6789:/volumes/_nogroup/58db8084-8292-4e76-a91f-dcbb65957e9a/7cafcb4b-c646-4431-a732-bb614cd1c6fd" \
  --share-name="TempShare"
```
This will create the share `/media/share/TempShare`, where everyone was write access to. However, you should continue saving your data into the your **MyData** folder (located in `/media/volume/MyData`). Things in the TempShare might get overwritten or deleted by other participants. 

`/media/share/MorphoCloudCephShare`

#### Data transfer between your local computer and remote instance
**Uploading to remote:** If your files are small (<100MB) and you have a stable connection, just dragging and dropping individual files to the browser window. Those files will be saved under your **MyData** volume, which is located at `/media/volumes/MyData/`. If your data is already on the cloud (e.g., MorphoSource, dropbox, google drive, etc), the fastest way is to use the Firefox browser built into the instance and directly download them to your remote session. Just remember to copy them to your `MyData`. </br>
**Downloading from the remote:** If the file is small, you can use the interface shown above in the screenshot (Box D:), which works one file at a time. 

If you have many files, or your files are large, we advise to use SFTP (Secure FTP) tools for bulk upload/download. There are many free tools, search one for your computer. Remember, any data you have generated and important for you, you should download to your own computer.
